This is a collection of scripts I've built up over the years. This is just the
beginning, there's much more to come.

All files in this repository are released under the BSD license. I'd appreciate
an email to let me know that you find something in here useful, and an
attribution in any released project, but it's not required. Just don't take my
work and claim it as your own.

You can contact me at frank@szczerba.net, my blog is http://carpe-cocoa.com.
